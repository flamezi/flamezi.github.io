This post will be based on the "*Domain-Specific Languages*" book by Martin Fowler and some info I grabbed from the internet. The overall introduction will be from the book but the examples I will be using will be from other sources since the book was not really very layman friendly for my taste.

**Introduction**

Domain-specific languages are not really what you hear about often in the industry. I, for once, have only vaguely remember such term. Most programmers will only have a limited knowledge about the techniques available that surround DSLs. Martin Fowler actually wrote his book to combat this status quo. He believes that this should change and people should be introduced to the wide range of techniques for DSL. This does not mean he is pushing us to use DSLs but rather he just wants us to be able to make informed decision if we will use it in our work.

His two main reasons for his action are:
1. Improving Productivity for Developers - DSLs can make codes easier to read because their intentions are easily understood thus making our lives easier when understanding complicated algorithms.
2. Improving Communication with Domain Experts - If the code is easier to read and intentions are clear, then most probably other people will have an easy time understanding our codes. Since the code will have a common context, it will be easier to communicate ideas about our implementation.

So basically, DSLs is about taking specific chunks of programming and making them easier to digest thus making them faster to write, modify, and test (not to mention less likely to be infested with defects). This also means we can show our real codes to our non-programmer team mates/counter parts since the code is easily digestible. The last part is actually one of the most common bottlenecks in the development world.
