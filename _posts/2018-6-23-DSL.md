This post will be based on the "*Domain-Specific Languages*" book by Martin Fowler and some info I grabbed from the internet. The overall introduction will be from the book but the examples I will be using will be from other sources since the book was not really very layman friendly for my taste.

**Everything you need to know about DSLs**
*Well maybe not everything but enough to get you started*

Domain-specific languages are not really what you hear about often in the industry. I, for once, have only vaguely remember such term. Most programmers will only have a limited knowledge about the techniques available that surround DSLs. Martin Fowler actually wrote his book to combat this status quo. He believes that this should change and people should be introduced to the wide range of techniques for DSL. This does not mean he is pushing us to use DSLs but rather he just wants us to be able to make informed decision if we will use it in our work.

His two main reasons for his action are:
1. Improving Productivity for Developers - DSLs can make codes easier to read because their intentions are easily understood thus making our lives easier when understanding complicated algorithms.
2. Improving Communication with Domain Experts - If the code is easier to read and intentions are clear, then most probably other people will have an easy time understanding our codes. Since the code will have a common context, it will be easier to communicate ideas about our implementation.

So basically, DSLs is about taking specific chunks of programming and making them easier to digest thus making them faster to write, modify, and test (not to mention less likely to be infested with defects). This also means we can show our real codes to our non-programmer team mates/counter parts since the code is easily digestible. The last part is actually one of the most common bottlenecks in the development world.

There are basically two types of DSLs: Internal and External DSLs. So, what's the distinction between the two? Well ... An **Internal DSL** is just writing code in the host language and is written in a way that gives us a more language-like feel. While an **External DSL** is a completely different or separate language which is parsed into data that is understandable by the host language.

You might be asking yourself, when should I consider making a DSL? Well ... You should consider using DSL when you are looking at part of the system that has rich business rules or work-flow. If you do a great job at writing the DSL, then it will allow your customers or business counterparts to understand the system's rules and technical logic.

You might be also wondering if you'll need something to get you started. Well ... Since Internal DSLs just use the same language as the host language, then the tools available for the host language should suffice. For External DSLs, some do require special tools such as parsing frameworks or libraries. There are also tools called **Language Workbenches** that can help you write your DSLs since they most likely would have sophisticated editors for you to use.
