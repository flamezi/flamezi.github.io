title: The Factory Pattern

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/factory/warehouse.png)

This is the fourth design pattern introduced in the Head First book. The official definition of the factory pattern is:

*It defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses."*

Basically, it's used to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface. It is used to avoid modifying existing code that might be initially placed in the main class. We then delegate the creation logic to a factory class.

The Design Principles it introduces:
1. Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
- *It suggests that our high-level components should not depend on our low-level components; rather, they should both depend on abstractions.*

Now I will try to guide you through the demonstration of this design pattern using my words the best that I can. I'm not really savvy in the lingo of the OO world. So please bear with me.
