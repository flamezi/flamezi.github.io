title: The Factory Pattern

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/factory/warehouse.png)

This is the fourth design pattern introduced in the Head First book. The official definition of the factory pattern is:

*It defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses."*

Basically, it's used to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface. It is used to avoid modifying existing code that might be initially placed in the main class. We then delegate the creation logic to a factory class.

The Design Principles it introduces:
1. Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
- *It suggests that our high-level components should not depend on our low-level components; rather, they should both depend on abstractions.*

Now I will try to guide you through the demonstration of this design pattern using my words the best that I can. I'm not really savvy in the lingo of the OO world. So please bear with me.

The book uses Pizza as its example. The scenario is the developer is tasked to create an ordering system for a pizza shop. So obviously, he would create the **Pizza** class. We also need an orderPizza() method. This will have our logic for all the needed preparation for the pizza to be ready for the customer.

But this implementation would be a mess if we ever needed to change our menu (which most restaurants tend to do). This is the perfect time to identify which parts of our code will vary and what will stay the same.

So what do we do? Well, we should first separate what varies and what does not. We can then see that the varying aspect is actually the creation logic. We can then separate this and create an object to handle this. These objects are called "**Factories**".

What we've done is actually called the "**Simple Factory**". The Simple Factory isn’t actually a Design Pattern; it’s more of a programming idiom. But it is commonly used, so the author gave it an Honorable Mention.

This simple factory will allow us to make Pizza in a specific way. But what if we need to create Pizza in completely different ways. We will need to apply the **Factory Pattern** for this task.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/factory/figure05.png)

We then need to put the createPizza() method back into PizzaStore, but this time as an abstract method, and then create a PizzaStore subclass for each regional style.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/factory/figure06.png)

By making the createPizza() method as an abstract method, all the PizzaStore subclasses must implement this method. We will then have a number of concrete subclasses of PizzaStore, each with its own pizza types, all fitting within the PizzaStore framework and still making use of our existing orderPizza() method.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/factory/figure07.png)

You may not see it but by doing this approach, we have effectively decoupled the orderPizza() method with the creation logic. This is because even though the orderPizza() method contains a lot of processes needed to create the pizza, it really doesn't know what real concrete classes are involved.

With these changes we’ve effectively gone from having an object handle the instantiation of our concrete classes to a set of subclasses that are now taking on that responsibility. This is possible because of our factory method. Remember, this method handles object creation and encapsulates it in
a subclass. This decouples the client code in the superclass from the object creation code in the subclass.

This is the **Factory Pattern**. This pattern has two main players which are the **Product** and the **Creator**.
